The initial folder will contain all the other folders from the project, as well ass the Dissertation document and the Powerpoint of my presentation for the project.

The other folders are:

Software:

  Contains all of the software I wrote for the project. This includes the scripts for processing all the individual plain text passwords leaks I used ('Database_preprocessing_scripts' folder). I did not provide the databases due to ethical concerns. Next there are the R scripts I used for creating the graphs used in the dissertation and for analysis of the HIBP_leaks database, which I created by using a web-scraping script on the HaveIBeenPwned website. Finally, there are the scripts I used to analyse the ZXCVBN scores of the plain text databases.

Supplementary:

  Contains all of the results of my analysis by applying the scripts inside 'Software', as well as some files from early on in the project. The graphs inside the ZXCVBN folders are made on the individual plain text password databases, by use of the ZXCVBN library, which is a password strength estimator. The other graphs are made on the database with leaks from HaveIBeenPwned, and aim to show the evolution of the different password hashing functions overall, as well as over the years, and the state of salt usage.
